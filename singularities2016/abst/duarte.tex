{\Large Abstract}
\end{center}
In this talk we will discuss some known results on blowing ups of modules in the particular case of the higher Nash blowup. We will describe an explicit ideal whose blowing up defines the higher Nash blowup of a hypersurface. Using this ideal we will prove a higher-order version of Nobile's theorem for normal hypersurfaces.
